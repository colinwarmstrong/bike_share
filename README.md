# Bike Share

### Abstract

Using Ruby, Rails, and ActiveRecord, this project analyses the Greater Bay Area's bike share program data.  It explores general statistics of bike trips and stations. It also explores usage statistics between stations and bikes docked, stations and other stations, and bike trips and weather data.  A bike shop was also created where visitors can browse bike accessories and add them to a shopping cart.  Visitors can register for an account in order to login and checkout the accessories in their cart.

### Usage

Visit [spoke-share.herokuapp.com/](http://spoke-share.herokuapp.com/) hosted on Heroku.  

From the homepage, you can login, create an account, visit the bike shop, or view any list of stations, trips, or weather conditions included in the data.

Once you create an account and login, you will have access to the dashboards for usage statistics related to stations, trips, and weather conditions.
